👋 Hi, I’m Jennifer Zajac. I started college at Northeastern University in 2019 studying biomedical engineering, but I liked programming so much I decided to become a software engineer instead. 😊

Here are some of the projects I've done on my journey so far:

-------------------------------------------------------------
💻 Programs:
- Image Processor (Java)
- Count cells in an image (MATLAB)
- ALU for a calculator (Verilog)

🕹️ Game recreations:
- Tetris (Racket)
- Mastermind (Java)
- Flood-It (Java)
- Freecell (Java)

😎 Other cool stuff:
- Password cracking
- SQL injections
- Create an electrocardiogram using op-amps

-------------------------------------------------------------

📫 Because of university policy, some of my projects are in private repositories. Please contact me for access.
